        Coming from North Eastern Kenya myself, I have seen firsthand the
        painful challenges young girls face, including rape, early marriages,
        FGM, and lack of access to mental health support. SaferSpace was born
        from a deep belief that no girl should face these struggles alone. Our
        mission is to offer hope, healing, and practical help. Growing up, I
        witnessed how harmful traditions and silence could destroy a girl's
        future. I saw friends forced into marriage before they turned 15, girls
        who dropped out of school after being cut, and others who suffered in
        silence after sexual violence, afraid to speak up due to stigma or fear
        of retaliation. These experiences left a lasting mark on me. I knew
        something had to change. I wanted to create a space where girls could
        feel safe, heard, and empowered , a place where they could access
        support without judgment or fear. That's why I created SaferSpace. It's
        more than just a platform; it's a movement. We use technology ,like our
        WhatsApp chatbot and web app ,to connect girls with counselors, peer
        support, and nearby health services. But at its heart, SaferSpace is
        about community. It's about letting every girl know: you are not alone,
        and your voice matters.
