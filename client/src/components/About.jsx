  SaferSpace is a trauma-informed digital platform built to support girls
  and women in Kenya facing gender-based violence, early marriage, and
  stigma. Through our secure platform, we offer access to mental health
  support, peer connection, and nearby healthcare — all in one safe,
  private space. Beyond immediate care, we connect survivors to long-term
  opportunities — from returning to school and joining tech programs, to
  finding mentorship and empowerment communities. Our goal is simple: to
  help every girl feel seen, supported, and free.

        Growing up in North Eastern Kenya, I saw firsthand how silence and fear
        shaped the lives of many girls. Friends were forced into early
        marriages. Some left school after undergoing FGM. Others endured abuse
        quietly, with no one safe to talk to.
        <br />
        <br />
        SaferSpace was created from those memories — and the belief that healing
        begins with being heard. We combined local lived experience with
        technology to offer real support: peer-led chat spaces, trauma-informed
        tools, and a growing network of counselors, clinics, and allies. At its
        core, SaferSpace is a movement for dignity, courage, and connection.
